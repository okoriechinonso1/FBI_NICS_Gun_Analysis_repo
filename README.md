This project analyzed the number of FBI NICS firearm background checks by month, state, and type between November 1998 and now

## INTRODUCTION

This data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. From the official site:

Mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and launched by the FBI on November 30, 1998, NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to 
instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms. Before ringing up the sale, cashiers call in a check to the FBI or to other designated 
agencies to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. More than 230 million such checks have been 
made, leading to more than 1.3 million denials.
